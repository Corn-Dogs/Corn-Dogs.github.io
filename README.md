Design changes:
    I decided to change the colour pallete because the range of colours was too big for me and was quite random. I decided to change it to plainly white, black, and some beigey colour.

1. I used https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_dropdowns.asp to understand dropdowns and help with the menu dropdown on the title page.

2. I used https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_link_mailto to add the "Email" function to the contact me section. It helped open the users email app with my email pretyped into the bar. It also lets me preadd a message.
