Design changes:
    I decided to change the colour pallete because the range of colours was too big for me and was quite random. I decided to change it to plainly white, black, and some beigey-ish colour.

    I also added more sections, as in an About Me section, and Contact Me section. Without the About Me section, people would not know what this website is for, and without the Contact Me section, the website wouldn't be useful (because the whole point is for people to see my photography and hire me or something)

1. I used https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_dropdowns.asp to understand dropdowns and help with the menu dropdown on the title page.

2. I used https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_link_mailto to add the "Email" function to the contact me section. It helped open the users email app with my email pretyped into the bar. It also lets me preadd a message.
