    <h2 id="About">WHO IS NICHOLAS DIXON?</h2>
      <div class="horizontal-container">
        <img src="assets/mystery-man.jpg" id="mystery">
        <p id="about-description"> Nicholas Dixon is a 6"3 tall women's right activist who loves to read feminist literature. Dixon is a
          rather peculiar creature, as he lives on a little hut on a rainbow. His colleagues often call him Leprochaun Man. This was before 
          they all mysteriously dissapeared. Dixon has claimed to have not seen anything on the night of, and has denied all allegations.
          <br>
          <br>
          Born in 1984 in Chicago, Illinouis, Dixon loves the little things in life and long walks on the beach. He especially enjoys
          smelling the roses on the way back to his rainbow shack. Most recently, he has gained an interest in photography. His most favourite thing 
          to take photos of is nature. Rumour has it that he visited Whistler, BC during the summer of '24 with his family and took many
          photos of nature, specifically of the stars. On one late night (Approximately August 1st at 12:32 A.M.), Dixon and his brother
          went out to take photos of the stars, using a method that they had acquired on social media previous day. With this website,
          I hope to be able to enlighten you to the photography work of Nicholas Dixon, to highlight how he truly reaches for the stars.

        <p id="description">This photo was taken on Nicholas' Auntie's (mother's sister) back porch. That night, they ate Deliveroo Domino's Pizza and watched The 
            Hangover on a projector they had set up outside. The flimsy homeade projector screen barely held up because of the wind, but they set up books and stools 
            to  attempt keep it rooted. In the end, when the movie was over, everyone was curled up in blankets and watched the stars.</p>
